      <p id="aboutUs" class="aboutUs">
        Our team brings together diverse talents, including <b>design</b>, <b>marketing</b>, and <b>frontend development</b>. Together, along with a team of engineers  and <b>key partners</b> we work seamlessly to create innovative solutions for our clients. <br><br><mark class="marking"> &nbsp;&nbsp;We aim to fully eradicate the floor-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;humidity issue that is one of the main&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;causes of water damage repairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</mark><br><br> So give it a Dry!

      <p class="aboutUs">Potential issues arising when using a Korean-style shower:
<br><br>
       
        <br><b>Water damage:</b> If water is allowed to splash onto the walls or other fixtures in the bathroom, it can potentially cause water damage over time. This can lead to mold growth, paint or wallpaper peeling, or other problems that can be costly to repair.<br>
        
        Proof: According to HomeAdvisor, the average cost of repairing water damage can range from $1,000 to $4,000.
        
         <br>
        <br><b>Lack of proper ventilation:</b> Inadequate bathroom ventilation can lead to excess moisture that damages building materials, causing structural problems, especially in poorly insulated or ventilated homes. It can also create a breeding ground for mold and mildew, which can cause respiratory issues for people with allergies or asthma.
        
       <br> Proof: Moisture damage can lead to mold growth within 24-48 hours, causing respiratory problems and other health issues, says the CDC.

         <br>
       <br> <b>Slippery floors:</b> Another common problem with Korean-style showers is the slippery floors. Since the entire bathroom floor is essentially the shower area, it can be quite slippery and dangerous to walk on, especially for young children or elderly individuals.
        
       <br> Proof: The National Floor Safety Institute reports that slip and fall accidents account for over one million hospital emergency room visits per year.</p>

<p class="aboutUs"><span class="quotes">"</span>We thought about a problem that we all experience frequently in our daily life, which could be bothering many other people as well. That is, especially after taking a shower, we are not able to walk in the shower freely, because it is going to wet our feet or socks while walking around the bathroom, which will lead to having a general feeling of discomfort in the short run, and more serious humidity issues in the long run, which would cost a massive amount of money regarding repairing the moldy damaged areas and possible injury-related costs due to the slippery floor and low quality of the air inside the bathroom and so on. We then thought about existing or in-development technologies that could best fit our solution to this problem. Combining all of the above, we came up with a device called “Drizone”.</p><p class="name">- Zhanel Sultanbekova -</p>

<p class="aboutUs">DRIZONE is combining existing technologies that can be found in <b>electric cars</b> ,<b>air conditioning</b>, or <b>hand drier</b>. The most challenging part consists of <b>combining those technologies</b> and make them work efficiently altogether.</p>

  <h4>Laminar effect air flow</h4><img id="laminar" src="Assets/laminar.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="middleTitle">DRIZONE is using laminar effect, meaning that the air flows in parallel layers instead of swirling around to better focus on wet areas and dry faster</p>

  <p class="middleTitle">DRIZONE will pop out from the walls when turned on using a <b>spring-loaded mechanism</b>, just like some electric cars' handles</p>

  <p class="middleTitle">DRIZONE's structure is built inside the wall, so that when taking shower or wetting the bathroom, the technology does not receive any water splash and can be more sustainable</p>
